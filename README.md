## 🔧 How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication** (8-step OAuth2-like flow):
   - Retrieves CSRF token and transaction ID
   - Submits login credentials
   - Confirms authentication
   - Obtains session cookies
   - Gets file download token

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Downloads half-hourly electricity usage data in CSV format
   - Parses and filters data (keeps last 90 days)
   - Calculates totals for each sensor's time period

3. **Caching**:
   - Data is cached for **24 hours** to minimize API calls
   - Automatic refresh every 24 hours
   - Manual refresh possible via Home Assistant Developer Tools

4. **Error Handling**:
   - **5 retry attempts** on network failures
   - **2-minute wait** between retries
   - **Next-day retry** if all attempts fail (24-hour cache expiry)

### Update Frequency

- **ESB Data Updates**: ESB Networks typically updates smart meter data once per day
- **Integration Polling**: Every 24 hours
- **Data Freshness**: Usually 1-2 days behind real-time (ESB processing delay)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### CAPTCHA Protection

ESB Networks has implemented CAPTCHA protection on their login system. This integration includes:
- ✅ **70+ diverse user agents** to minimize detection
- ✅ **Random delays** between requests (2-20 seconds)
- ✅ **CAPTCHA detection** with clear error messages

**If CAPTCHA is triggered:**
- The integration will log a clear error message
- You may see: `"ESB Networks requires CAPTCHA verification"`
- This could be temporary rate limiting or permanent security change
- Currently **no automated solution** exists for CAPTCHA bypass

### Data Availability

- ESB Networks data is typically **1-2 days behind** real-time
- Data updates **once per day** on ESB's servers (usually overnight)
- First data may take **24-48 hours** after smart meter installation

### API Limitations

- This integration uses ESB's **consumer-facing web interface** (not an official API)
- ESB may change their authentication flow at any time
- Integration may break if ESB makes website changes

## 🔍 Troubleshooting


### Common Issues

#### Integration Fails to Load

**Symptoms**: Integration doesn't appear or shows as failed in integrations page

**Solutions**:

1. Check Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages:
   - Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**
   - Look for messages containing `esb_smart_meter`

2. Verify Home Assistant version:
   - Minimum required: **2023.1.0**
   - Check current version in **Settings** → **About**

3. Ensure dependencies are installed:
   - Restart Home Assistant to trigger dependency installation
   - Check `custom_components/esb_smart_meter/manifest.json` for required packages

#### Authentication Fails

**Symptoms**: Setup fails with "Invalid credentials" or authentication error

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify ESB Account Credentials**:
   - Try logging into [myaccount.esbnetworks.ie](https://myaccount.esbnetworks.ie/) manually
   - Use the exact same email and password in the integration
   - Check for extra spaces in username/password

2. **Validate MPRN Format**:
   - Must be exactly **11 digits**
   - No spaces, hyphens, or other characters
   - Example: `10012345678`
   - Find on electricity bill or ESB account page

3. **Check for CAPTCHA**:
   - If logs show `"CAPTCHA detected"`, ESB is blocking automated login
   - This may be temporary rate limiting or permanent security change
   - Wait 24 hours and try again
   - Check integration logs for detailed CAPTCHA error messages

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure Home Assistant can reach `esbnetworks.ie`
   - Check firewall/proxy settings
   - Try accessing ESB website from Home Assistant host

#### No Data Showing

**Symptoms**: Sensors created but show "Unknown" or "Unavailable"

**Solutions**:

1. **Wait for Data Update**:
   - ESB data updates **once per day** (usually overnight)
   - Integration polls **every 24 hours**
   - First data may take 24-48 hours after setup

2. **Check Data Availability**:
   - Log into ESB website and verify you can see usage data
   - New smart meter installations may have 1-2 day delay

3. **Review Logs**:
   - Enable debug logging (see below)
   - Look for errors during data fetch
   - Check for CSV parsing errors or size limit warnings

4. **Force Update**:
   - Delete and re-add the integration
   - Or wait for next 24-hour refresh cycle

#### Sensors Show Stale Data

**Symptoms**: Data doesn't update daily

**Solutions**:

1. Check cache status in logs (enable debug mode)
2. Verify ESB website shows newer data
3. Restart Home Assistant to force cache refresh
4. Check for errors in logs preventing data updates

### Enabling Debug Logging

To get detailed diagnostic information:

1. **Add to `configuration.yaml`**:

   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.esb_smart_meter: debug
   ```

2. **Restart Home Assistant**

3. **View Logs**:
   - Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**
   - Download full logs if needed for issue reporting

**Debug logs include**:
- Complete authentication flow (8 steps)
- URLs accessed and response status codes
- HTML response previews
- CAPTCHA detection details
- CSV parsing information
- Cache hit/miss events
- Retry attempt details

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Sensor Names

Rename sensors in the Home Assistant UI:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click on the **ESB Smart Meter** integration
3. Click on any sensor entity
4. Click the gear icon (⚙️)
5. Change **Name** and **Entity ID** as desired

### Creating Custom Sensors

Use template sensors for custom time periods:

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "ESB Yesterday"
        unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
        state: >
          {% set today = states('sensor.esb_electricity_usage_today') | float %}
          {% set last24 = states('sensor.esb_electricity_usage_last_24_hours') | float %}
          {{ (last24 - today) | round(2) }}
        icon: "mdi:flash"
```

### Energy Dashboard Integration

The integration imports your readings into Home Assistant's long-term statistics
(hourly, at their real timestamps), so the Energy Dashboard shows accurate history
despite ESB's 1-2 day delay. These are carried by two **History** sensors grouped
under the device:

- **ESB Electricity Usage: History** (`sensor.esb_electricity_usage_history`) — consumption
- **ESB Electricity Export: History** (`sensor.esb_electricity_export_history`) — export to grid

They appear under the **ESB Smart Meter** device in the statistic picker (shown by their name above).

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards** → **Energy** → **Edit Dashboard**
2. Click **Add grid connection**
3. Set **Energy imported from grid** to **ESB Electricity Usage: History**
4. If you export to the grid, set **Energy exported to grid** to **ESB Electricity Export: History**
5. Configure tariff pricing if desired

**Note**: Use the `*_history` sensors above (not the period `sensor.esb_electricity_usage_*`
entities) for the Energy Dashboard — they carry the correct historic timestamps, so
scrolling back to past dates shows real usage. Data appears 1-2 days after use because
of ESB's publishing delay. The energy config page may show the History sensors as "Entity unavailable" — this is expected and harmless as they are intentionally stateless.

### Automation Examples

**Alert on high daily usage**:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "High Electricity Usage Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.esb_electricity_usage_today
        above: 30  # kWh
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "High Electricity Usage"
          message: "Today's usage: {{ states('sensor.esb_electricity_usage_today') }} kWh"
```

**Monthly usage report**:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Monthly Electricity Report"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "09:00:00"
      - platform: template
        value_template: "{{ now().day == 1 }}"
    action:
      - service: notify.email
        data:
          title: "Monthly Electricity Report"
          message: "Last 30 days usage: {{ states('sensor.esb_electricity_usage_last_30_days') }} kWh"
```
